h1. Acts as Manifesto

This is a basic manifesto generator for Ruby on Rails.

h2. Install

Install the plugin using the following command:

@script/plugin install git://github.com/akosma/actsasmanifesto.git@

If you want, you could rename the "trunk" folder in your vendor/plugins directory, to a nicer name (like actsasmanifesto or something like that).

h2. How to use

@./script/generate manifesto@

This generates a basic manifesto + signatures model, a controller and some basic views, following the RESTful design mantra. For this reason, in the config/routes.rb file you should add the following:

@map.resources :manifestos, :member => { :sign => :post }@

After generating the manifesto infrastructure, you can delete the plugin.

Consult the "Acts As Manifesto wiki":http://wiki.github.com/akosma/actsasmanifesto for more information.

h2. Future Improvements

Future versions of the plugin will feature the following:

* Users will be able to sign up to the site and manage their manifestos;
* Signatures could be validated via e-mail if needed;
* Use of RJS to have nice effects on the page;
* Change the names of the models generated by the plugin;
* Allow Markaby or Textile for the manifesto description and signature comments;
* RSS feed for manifesto signatures;
* Integrate Akismet for fighting against spam;
* Add pagination for comments;
* Add prettier CSS default options;
* Manifestos and signatures could be private (only to people signed up) or public (available to everyone);
