Acts as Manifesto
=================

This is a basic manifesto generator for Ruby on Rails.

Install
=======

Install the plugin using the following command:

  script/plugin install http://actsasmanifesto.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
  
If you want, you could rename the "trunk" folder in your vendor/plugins directory, to a nicer name (like actsasmanifesto or something like that).

How to use
==========

  ./script/generate manifesto

This generates a basic manifesto + signatures model, a controller and some basic views, following the RESTful design mantra. For this reason, in the config/routes.rb file you should add the following:

  map.resources :manifestos, :member => { :sign => :post }

After generating the manifesto infrastructure, you can delete the plugin.

Consult the Acts As Manifesto wiki for more information: http://code.google.com/p/actasmanifesto/

Future Improvements
===================

Future versions of the plugin will feature the following:

- Users will be able to sign up to the site and manage their manifestos;
- Signatures could be validated via e-mail if needed;
- Use of RJS to have nice effects on the page;
- Change the names of the models generated by the plugin;
- Allow Markaby or Textile for the manifesto description and signature comments;
- RSS feed for manifesto signatures;
- Integrate Akismet for fighting against spam;
- Add pagination for comments;
- Add prettier CSS default options;
- Manifestos and signatures could be private (only to people signed up) or public (available to everyone);
